Hi Buddy,

I fixed this issue, the steps are as follows:

After I checked all the profiles and binary files of SSH, I found the issue is not about the profiles, is the binary files /usr/bin/ssh and /usr/sbin/sshd.

Maybe someone changed them, and gave them some special rights, such as can't be removed and deleted.
So I got rid of all the special rights of them, reinstalled all the SSH programs. Then it was OK.

After that, I checked some logs, tried to find some information if we were hacked by someone.

But I'm sorry I couldn't find any useful information. Now I think we'd better to change all the passwords of existing users, especially the users who can login this server.

[root@server ssh]# lsattr /usr/bin/ssh
-u--ia------- /usr/bin/ssh
[root@server ssh]# lsattr /usr/sbin/sshd
-u--ia------- /usr/sbin/sshd

[root@server ssh]# chattr -uia /usr/bin/ssh
[root@server ssh]# chattr -uia /usr/sbin/sshd

[root@server ssh]# lsattr /usr/bin/ssh
------------- /usr/bin/ssh
[root@server ssh]# lsattr /usr/sbin/sshd
------------- /usr/sbin/sshd

yum install openssh-server
yum install openssh-clients
yum install openssh

[root@server ssh]# rpm -qa | grep ssh
openssh-server-4.3p2-72.el5_6.3
openssh-clients-4.3p2-72.el5_6.3
openssh-4.3p2-72.el5_6.3
